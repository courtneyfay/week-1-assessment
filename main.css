/*#### Requirements (CSS)

- Use display, clear, and floats to position elements on the page
- Look up and use at least two CSS properties and values that may not have been covered in class, for example:
  - `background: url("YOUR-LINK.COM")`
  - `list-style`
  - `text-decoration`
  - `text-transform`
- all major parts of CSS explained with comments
- final product perfectly matches all items of page

**Bonus:**
- The repeating background image is oldschool. Can you do it with a CSS3 gradient? 
- The 'frame.png' image is also unnecessary. Can you do it with `box-shadow`, `border-radius`, and `position: relative`?
